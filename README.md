# Improved-BPSO
This is the demo implementation of structure learning using improved particle colony optimization algorithm presented in the paper:

Ruohai Di, Xiaoguang Gao, Zhigao Guo. Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks based on Improved Particle Colony Optimization Algorithm, Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical Universtiy, 32(5): 749-755, 2014.

Note that, the BNT toolbox (https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt) is required in order to run the demo. To run the code, you only have to run the 'main' file.
